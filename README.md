# Learning Process for Starcraft 2 bot competition Artificial Overmind

This repository is made for documenting the learning and progress of creating a Starcraft 2 bot for the Artificial Overmind competition.  ( https://artificial-overmind.reaktor.com/?fbclid=IwAR2LkNVR3qdLrUp2_Jv8hQBYnnWVqMrudKR0Ttj8gZ9fY0DsP0P1HyN0RRs )

The repository is structured in a way such that all the sub repo is effort of learning exercises (including simple problem formulation) that have been conducted.
Some of them lack "What I learned" esque documentation of the result and that might be good to have, but most learning and notes exist on my NOTION account.

When this repo get a bit more flesh on the bone, the documentattion should be updated.

## Todo List

* Get a better understanding at PyTorch.

* pysc2 API (Input, Output, how to play replays, minigames)

* Reinforcement Learning (for example: Q-Learning, delayed reward)




## Environment and Library

* Tensorflow ( https://www.tensorflow.org/ )

* pysc2 ( https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 )

* PyTorch ( )
* OpenAi gym ( https://gym.openai.com/ )

The environemnts can all be installed through the pip command:

```
pip install tensorflow pysc2 gym
```
