## Todo List

### Todo until **29th May**

Get an good overview of following components:

* pysc2 API (Input, Output, how to play replays, minigames)

* Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, delayed reward)

The purpose of the goal is to be able to identify reasonable learning and implementation goals over the coming weeks. No deep understanding is required but one should at least be able to have a grip about how to proceed the following week.


## Environment and Library

* Tensorflow 

* pysc2

* OpenAi gym
