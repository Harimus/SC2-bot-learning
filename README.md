# Learning Process for Starcraft 2 bot competition 

This repository is made for documenting the learning and progress of creating a Starcraft 2 bot with RL.

The repository is structured in a way such that all the sub repo is effort of learning exercises (including simple problem formulation) that have been conducted.
Some of them lack "What I learned" esque documentation of the result and that might be good to have, but most learning and notes exist on my NOTION account.

When this repo get a bit more flesh on the bone, the documentation should be updated.

## Todo List

* Get a better understanding at PyTorch.

* pysc2 API (Input, Output, how to play replays, minigames)

* DRL and HRL




## Environment and Library


Note to myself: For SpinningUpRL tutorial and tests, I'm using Python3.6 Conda Environment.

* Tensorflow ( https://www.tensorflow.org/ )

* pysc2 ( https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 )

* PyTorch ( )
* OpenAi gym ( https://gym.openai.com/ )

The environemnts can all be installed through the pip command:

```
pip install tensorflow pysc2 gym
```
